# Gas Sensing Project

This project investigates gas sensing behavior through simulation and data analysis, focusing on surface coverage dynamics and electrical characteristics.

## üìÇ Project Files and Descriptions

- `Gas_Sensing_Single.ipynb`  
  This notebook simulates and analyzes the surface coverage of a single gas molecule adsorbed on the sensor over simulation time.

- `Gas_Sensing_Multiple.ipynb`  
  This notebook studies the surface coverage of multi-component gas mixtures adsorbed on the sensor over simulation time, as well as the time-dependent changes of the system's resistance.

- `Gas_Sensing_3D.ipynb`  
  This notebook examines the surface coverage of a single gas molecule adsorbed on the sensor under different temperatures and time points, with 3D visualization.

- `IV_read.ipynb`  
  This notebook processes data from NEGF (Non-Equilibrium Green‚Äôs Function) calculations, including current, resistance, and sensitivity analysis.

## üöÄ How to Use
