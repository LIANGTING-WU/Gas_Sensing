# Gas Sensing Project

This project provides a set of Python notebooks for analyzing and visualizing gas sensor data as well as electrical measurements from gas sensing experiments. The tools aim to facilitate data processing, feature extraction, and insightful visualization for various gas sensing scenarios.

## Notebooks Overview

- **Gas_Sensing_Single.ipynb**  
  Focuses on the analysis of gas sensing data from a single sensor device. It includes steps for data preprocessing, baseline correction, and extraction of key sensor response features to evaluate sensor performance.

- **Gas_Sensing_Multiple.ipynb**  
  Extends the analysis to multiple sensors or multiple test cycles. It supports batch data processing, comparative analysis, and statistical evaluation across sensors or repeated measurements to identify trends and variabilities.

- **Gas_Sensing_3D.ipynb**  
  Implements three-dimensional data visualization, enabling exploration of sensor responses over time and across multiple sensors simultaneously. The interactive 3D plots help reveal complex patterns and correlations in the dataset.

- **IV_read.ipynb**  
  Dedicated to reading and analyzing current-voltage (I-V) measurement data related to gas sensing devices. It parses raw I-V data files, plots characteristic curves, and extracts electrical parameters essential for understanding sensor behavior.

## Getting Started
